### About this example
This is a demonstration of a stated choice experiment designed with PixelSurvey. Our example develop a stated choice experiment with two alternatives, where one attirbute is an image and the other is a standard numeric attribute. The experiment is based on a custom design located in the `assets/exp1/sc_custom_design.csv`.

### Survey structure
- Homepage (this page)
- Informed Consent
- Participant Screening (three questions)
- An Stated Choice Experiment activity with 8 choice tasks  
- A questionnaire with 4 questions about housing preferences and habits
- Thank you page

### How to start building your own survey
1. I suggest modifying the content of this survey to be familiar with the structure and YAML format.
2. Then, you can start building your own survey by changing the content and structure.
3. Remember that PixelSurvey just read an experiment design file, so you can create your own custom design with any software (e.g., Ngene, Excel, etc.) and upload it to the `assets` folder. Then, you just need to specify the path to your custom design in the `custom_design` field of the experiment activity.

I hope this example helps you to get started with PixelSurvey and to design your own experiments and surveys. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out!
